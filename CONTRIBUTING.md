# Contributing to Fibre

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

Please do not hesitate to contact myself at mr.ben.osborne@gmail.com if you have any questions, it may seem daunting at first but we are all here to help each other, contribute to open source software and do the best we can.

# Issues
You can help out by looking at the current issues we have open and add to the discussion, you may have a better way about doing specific tasks, don't be shy.

# Ready to code?
If you are ready to code, head over to the **Projects** tab and find the current project we are working on, the current project will likely have the next version number in it's name,
from there you can take a look at any issues in the "Todo" column.

## Create a branch using the following syntax
1.X.X-{What you are working on}

Make sure you move the issue into the **In Progress** column within the **Project**.

**E.g:**

1.1.1-redirects-module

## Commits
Keep your commit descriptions short and sweet, use a pull request for more descriptive information before the branch is merged.

# Ready to create a pull request?
When you are ready with your code go ahead and make a pull request, make sure you make the pull request against the version you are working towards branch name.

For example, if you are working on the project **1.3.1**, then make a pull request to merge into the branch **1.3.1**.
