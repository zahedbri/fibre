Please do not hesitate to contact myself at mr.ben.osborne@gmail.com if you have any questions, it may seem daunting at first but we are all here to help each other, contribute to open source software and do the best we can.

# Issues
You can help out by looking at the current issues we have open and add to the discussion, you may have a better way about doing specific tasks, don't be shy.

# Ready to code?
If you are ready to code, head over to the **Projects** tab and find the current project we are working on, the current project will likely have the next version number in it's name, 
from there you can take a look at any issues in the "Todo" column.
